\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the

    $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,

\section{Introduction}
Path planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in robotics, enabling robots to move efficiently and safely within constrained environments. Unlike mobile robots that navigate in free space, robotic arms must operate in a higher-dimensional joint space, where each degree of freedom contributes to the overall complexity of motion planning. Traditional inverse kinematics (IK) methods solve for joint angles that satisfy end-effector goals, but they often struggle with obstacle avoidance and computational efficiency in real-time applications.

This document provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a 2D robotic arm path planning system based on a graph-based inverse kinematics (IK) approach with A* search. The developed program will be referred to as 2D Robot Arm Path Planning (2D-RAPP) throughout this document. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of 2D-RAPP. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of 2D-RAPP. With the exception of system constraints, this SRS remains abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.

This document serves as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on numerical algorithms, data structures, and programming frameworks. The verification and validation plan will outline the steps required to increase confidence in the software’s correctness, reliability, and performance. 

Although this SRS follows a structured documentation approach, it does not impose any specific software development methodology. Regardless of whether a waterfall, agile, or iterative development process is followed, it remains useful to present the documentation in a way that maintains clarity and logical structure, as recommended by Parnas and Clements.



\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
The scope of the requirements includes path planning for a 2D robotic arm with N revolute joints, operating in a workspace with circular obstacles. The system is designed to compute collision-free paths in joint space, using distance-based inverse kinematics and search algorithms.


\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
Reviewers of this documentation should have a fundamental understanding of robotics kinematics at an undergraduate level, specifically covering forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and path planning. Familiarity with graph-based search algorithms (such as A*) and numerical optimization techniques is also recommended.

The users of 2D-RAPP (e.g., robotics researchers, engineers) may have varying levels of expertise, as explained in Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}. However, those involved in **reviewing, modifying, or maintaining this SRS** should have a **strong background in computational kinematics and algorithmic path planning**.


\subsection{Organization of Document}

This document follows the standard structure of an SRS for scientific computing software. It begins with the problem statement and goals, followed by theoretical foundations, definitions, and assumptions. The document then presents instance models and specific requirements.

The problem is introduced through kinematic models and path planning techniques, including forward and inverse kinematics and graph-based search methods. Assumptions related to joint constraints and obstacle avoidance are also outlined.

Readers can approach this document either top-down, starting from goals to implementation, or bottom-up, beginning with instance models and tracing back to theoretical foundations. The instance model IM:PathPlanning defines the core algorithm for collision-free motion planning of a 2D robot arm.


\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints. 


\subsection{System Context}


Fig.~\ref{Fig:SysCon} illustrates the system context. The circle represents the user, an external entity providing inputs to the system. The rectangle represents the software system, 2D-RAPP. Arrows indicate the data flow between the user and the system.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig:SysCon}
\end{figure}

The interaction between the user and the system is described as follows:

\subsubsection*{User Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide the input data to the system, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initial joint angles (\(q_{\text{init}}\)) to specify the starting configuration of the robotic arm.
        \item Goal position (\(x_{\text{goal}}, y_{\text{goal}}\)) to indicate the desired end-effector target.
        \item Obstacle data, including radii (\(r_i\)) and positions (\(O_i = (x_i, y_i)\)).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ensure the input data is accurate and in the required units.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2D-RAPP Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detect input errors, such as invalid data types or inconsistent units.
    \item Verify that the inputs satisfy physical and software constraints.
    \item Compute a collision-free trajectory for the robotic arm, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Joint angles (\(q\), \(\dot{q}\), \(\ddot{q}\)) for each motion stage.
        \item Cartesian path (\(x, y\)) of the end-effector.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Provide a visual representation of the robotic arm's movement and obstacle avoidance.
\end{itemize}

This system context defines the roles and interactions between the user and the 2D-RAPP system, ensuring clarity in the data flow and system responsibilities.

\end{figure}

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}


This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

  \item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_KinematicMotionOnly}:] 
  The motion of the robotic arm is modeled purely kinematically, without considering the effects of dynamics such as forces, torques, or friction. (RefBy: IM:PathPlanning)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_LinkLengthsConstant}:] 
  The lengths of all links in the robotic arm are constant and do not change during motion. (RefBy: GD:ForwardKinematics)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_JointMotionContinuous}:] 
  The joint angles of the robotic arm vary smoothly and continuously without sudden jumps. (RefBy: IM:TrajectoryGeneration)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_NoMechanicalDeflection}:] 
  The robotic arm links are considered rigid, meaning there is no mechanical deflection or deformation. (RefBy: GD:InverseKinematics)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_ObstacleShapeCircular}:] 
  Obstacles in the environment are approximated as circles with predefined radii. (RefBy: IM:CollisionDetection)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_TrajectoryDiscretized}:] 
  The planned trajectory is discretized into a series of intermediate waypoints in joint space. (RefBy: IM:TrajectoryGeneration)

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_InitialAndGoalConfigurationsKnown}:] 
  The initial joint configuration and the goal joint configuration are known before path planning begins. (RefBy: IM:PathPlanning)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on. The theoretical models serve as fundamental principles governing the kinematic motion and path planning of the robotic arm.

    \item $L_2$: Length of the second link (\si{\centi\metre}).
  \end{itemize}

% #6 Notes
{
  This forward kinematics model assumes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rigid links: The links are assumed to be perfectly rigid and do not deform under load (\aref{A_LinkLengthsConstant}).
    \item Fixed base: The base of the arm is considered stationary, located at the origin $(0, 0)$.
    \item Ideal joints: The joints rotate without friction or other physical limitations.
    \item Planar motion: The arm operates in a 2D plane, and there is no out-of-plane movement.
  \end{itemize}

  These assumptions ensure simplicity and accuracy for theoretical modeling. For real-world applications, additional factors such as joint compliance, link flexibility, and external forces may need to be considered.

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and
  assumptions listed reference the current model, definition or assumption.
  This information is given for traceability.  Ref. By provides a pointer in the
  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if TM1 is referenced by GD2, that means that GD2 will
  explicitly include a reference to TM1.}

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
  For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The
  GD could take the general law and apply it to get a 1D equation.}

This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.

  Description & 
                $T_C$ is the temperature of the coil (\si{\celsius}).  $T_W$ is the temperature of the water (\si{\celsius}).  
                The heat flux out of the coil, $q_C$ (\si{\watt\per\square\metre}), is found by
                assuming that Newton's Law 
                of Cooling applies (\aref{A_Newt_coil}).  This law (\dref{NL}) is used on the surface of
                the coil, which has area $A_C$ (\si{\square\metre}) and heat 
                transfer coefficient $h_C$
                (\si{\watt\per\square\metre\per\celsius}).  This equation

                of the coil (\aref{A_tlcoil}).

\subsubsection{Data Types}\label{sec_datatypes}

\plt{This section is optional.  In many scientific computing programs it isn't
  necessary, since the inputs and outpus are straightforward types, like reals,
  integers, and sequences of reals and integers.  However, for some problems it
  is very helpful to capture the type information.}

\plt{The data types are not derived; they are simply stated and used by other
  models.}

\plt{All data types must be used by at least one of the models.}

\plt{For the mathematical notation for expressing types, the recommendation is
  to use the notation of~\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.}

This section collects and defines all the data types needed to document the
models. \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional
  definitions as appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

\plt{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goals \plt{reference your goals} are solved by \plt{reference your instance
  models}.  \plt{other details, with cross-references where appropriate.}

  appropriate.}

\subsubsection*{Derivation of ...}

\plt{The derivation shows how the IM is derived from the TMs/GDs.  In cases
  where the derivation cannot be described under the Description field, it will
  be necessary to include this subsection.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

  \item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]  
    The system shall accept the following inputs from the user:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Initial joint angles \( q_{\text{init}} = (\theta_1, \theta_2) \) in radians.
      \item Goal position \( (x_{\text{goal}}, y_{\text{goal}}) \) in Cartesian coordinates (\si{\centi\metre}).
      \item Obstacle positions \( O_i = (x_i, y_i) \) and radii \( r_i \) (\si{\centi\metre}).
      \item Link lengths \( L_1, L_2 \) of the robotic arm (\si{\centi\metre}).
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:]  
    The system shall echo all input values to ensure correctness before computation.
  
  \item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:]  
    The system shall perform the following calculations:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Compute the forward kinematics to determine the end-effector position.
      \item Determine the collision-free path from \( q_{\text{init}} \) to the goal using A* search.
      \item Generate the sequence of intermediate joint configurations \( q(t) \) for smooth motion.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:]  
    The system shall verify that:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The computed path avoids all obstacles.
      \item The final joint configuration corresponds to the given goal position.
      \item The output trajectory is continuous and feasible for the robotic arm.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:]  
    The system shall output the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The computed path in joint space, represented as a sequence of joint angles \( q(t) \).
      \item The Cartesian positions of the end-effector throughout the motion.
      \item A visualization of the planned motion with the robotic arm and obstacles.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

  This section defines the nonfunctional requirements that specify the qualities and characteristics the software should exhibit.
  
  \noindent \begin{itemize}
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]  
    \textbf{Accuracy} \\
    The system shall compute the robotic arm trajectory with an accuracy sufficient for motion planning in a dynamic environment. The precision of the joint angles shall be within \(0.01\) radians, and the calculated Cartesian positions of the end-effector shall have an error margin within \(0.1\) cm. The accuracy shall be validated through simulation and empirical testing.
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]  
    \textbf{Maintainability} \\
    The effort required to make likely modifications to the software (such as adjusting the planning algorithm or adding new constraints) shall be at most \(10\%\) of the original development time, assuming the same development resources are available. Code modularization and documentation will facilitate future modifications.

  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Verifiability}:]  
    \textbf{Verifiability} \\
    The correctness of the system shall be tested with a complete verification and validation (V\&V) plan. The outputs shall be compared against theoretical models and experimental data.
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Understandability}:]  
    \textbf{Understandability} \\
    The software shall follow a modular architecture with clear documentation, including a module guide and interface specification. Each function and class shall have inline comments explaining its purpose and usage.
  
  \item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Reusability}:]  
    \textbf{Reusability} \\
    The system shall be designed with reusability in mind, allowing for easy adaptation to different robotic configurations. The kinematic and planning modules shall be abstracted so they can be reused in other robotic applications.
  
  \end{itemize}
  

\subsection{Rationale}

\plt{Provide a rationale for the decisions made in the documentation.  Rationale
should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
typical values.}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
    the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
    the unlikely changes.  The design can assume that the changes listed will
    not occur.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

\plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
  the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
  the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
  where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
  course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
  organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
  requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}
