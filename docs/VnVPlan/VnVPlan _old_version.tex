This document describes the Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for our software system, which focuses on collision-free path planning for a 2D robotic manipulator in an environment with circular obstacles. The system generates a valid trajectory from a given start configuration to a goal configuration while ensuring that the robotic arm does not collide with obstacles. The verification and validation process aims to assess the correctness, efficiency, and robustness of the path-planning algorithm and collision detection mechanism.
The document outlines our approach, objectives, and the tests to be performed to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements. A roadmap of the plan is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Section 1 covers general information about the software, its purpose, and the primary V\&V objectives.
  \item Section 2 provides details on the V\&V plan, the team, and the methods and tools used.
  \item Section 3 describes the system-level tests for both functional and nonfunctional requirements.
  \item Section 4 focuses on unit-level testing, including scope, test coverage, and traceability to modules.
\end{itemize}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
The software under test is a \textbf{2D Robot Arm Path-Planning System} that computes collision-free trajectories for a robotic manipulator with circular obstacles. The system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discretizes the robotâ€™s joint space and represents possible configurations on a toroidal grid.
    \item Uses the A* algorithm to compute a valid trajectory from the start configuration to the goal configuration in joint space.
    \item Detects and avoids collisions by checking intersections between the robotic arm links and circular obstacles.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objective of this Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan is to ensure the correctness, reliability, and efficiency of the 2D Robot Arm Path-Planning System. This system computes collision-free trajectories for a robotic manipulator navigating around circular obstacles. The specific objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build confidence in software correctness}: Ensure that the planned paths are collision-free and feasible in joint space.
    \item \textbf{Validate the effectiveness of A* path planning}: Verify that the system correctly finds a valid trajectory between the initial and goal configurations.
    \item \textbf{Ensure robustness of collision detection}: Confirm that obstacle avoidance is correctly implemented and that no invalid paths are generated.
    \item \textbf{Assess computational efficiency}: Measure execution time and memory usage to ensure the system performs well under different obstacle configurations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Out of Scope:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Usability Testing}: The system is evaluated based on correctness and performance, not user experience or interface design.
    \item \textbf{Real-world Hardware Validation}: The plan verifies software functionality but does not include hardware implementation or physical robot testing.
    \item \textbf{External Library Verification}: The system assumes that third-party numerical and optimization libraries (e.g., NumPy) are already tested by their providers.
\end{itemize}

This plan prioritizes correctness, efficiency, and collision-free navigation, acknowledging that usability and physical testing are beyond the current project scope.


\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}
\textbf{Challenge Level:} General (per agreement with the course instructor).
\textbf{Extras:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A brief user manual for researchers/engineers.
    \item Potential code walkthroughs and extended design documentation, as time and resources permit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification} (SRS) :
  This defines the required functionalities for the 2D robot arm path planner, including input constraints, output specifications, and performance requirements.\cite{SRS}
  \item \textbf{Other Project Documents} (MG, MIS, etc.):
  These documents describe the design and detailed modules of the system. They are relevant for deriving unit tests and ensuring that design decisions align with requirements.
  \item \textbf{Code Reference}:
  An example is the A* toroidal grid code for obstacle navigation, which will be referenced or adapted for verifying path-planning correctness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Unit Test Description}

Unit testing will occur once the detailed designs are finalized (see the \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}). This section outlines the general approach to module-level testing, ensuring that core functionalities perform correctly and efficiently.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

All modules described in the \textbf{MIS} are in-scope for unit testing, except for any third-party libraries. The following modules have been identified as the highest priority:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inverse Kinematics (IK) Solver} -- Computes joint angles for a given target position.
    \item \textbf{Collision Detection Module} -- Ensures that paths do not intersect obstacles.
    \item \textbf{Path Planner Module} -- Generates valid paths based on obstacles and goal configurations.
\end{itemize}

External libraries for mathematical operations (e.g., matrix solvers) are assumed to be tested by their providers and are excluded from unit testing.

\subsection{Unit Testing Strategy}

The testing strategy follows a combination of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Black-box testing:} Verifying correct outputs given specific inputs.
    \item \textbf{White-box testing:} Checking internal logic using test coverage tools.
    \item \textbf{Edge-case testing:} Ensuring robustness for boundary conditions.
    \item \textbf{Automated testing:} Using scripted tests for reproducibility via continuous integration (CI) with GitHub Actions.
