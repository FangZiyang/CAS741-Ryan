\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
The project involves developing a framework for distance-geometric representation of 2D (planar) robot arms to facilitate path planning in environments with circular obstacles. Unlike traditional inverse kinematics (IK) methods, the proposed approach uses a geometric graph representation of the manipulator and formulates the IK problem as a distance-based graph problem. The goal is to determine the joint positions and angles along a feasible path that avoids obstacles and satisfies the goal configuration.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\textbf{Inputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Environment: Circular obstacles defined by positions (x,y) and radius.
    \item Robot arm: Number of joints and their respective lengths.
    \item Initial pose: Configuration of the robot arm at the start.
    \item Goal: Desired end-effector position or pose.
    \item Number of poses: Initial value for the number of intermediate poses along the path.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distance-geometric representation: Joint positions at each time step.
    \item Angular representation: Joint angles along the path to the goal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Researchers and developers in robotics and motion planning.
    \item Robotics engineers working on manipulators and autonomous systems.
    \item End users interested in robust and scalable IK solutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}
\textbf{Hardware:} Simulation environment.\\
\textbf{Software:} Python or MATLAB-based implementation, integrating with existing libraries include GraphIK and Convex Iteration-based solvers.

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a framework that generalizes to various 2D robotic manipulators.
    \item Ensure accurate and efficient path planning through distance-geometric representations.
    \item Validate the approach using benchmark problems and compare with traditional IK solvers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend the framework to include angular velocity and acceleration calculations.
    \item Incorporate additional obstacle types or dynamic obstacles.
    \item Optimize the algorithm for real-time applications.
    \item Extend the framework to handle 3D robot arms, enabling path planning in three-dimensional space.
    \item Enable real-world testing on physical robotic systems to validate the algorithmâ€™s practical applicability and performance.
    \item Achieve higher computational efficiency compared to existing solvers, demonstrating faster convergence and lower computational resource usage.
\end{itemize}


\section{Challenge Level and Extras}
\textbf{Challenge Level:} General.\\
\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is a problem with a general-level challenge. 
    \item It requires a solid understanding of robotics kinematics, inverse kinematics solving techniques, and convex optimization theories. 
    \item Solving this problem involves integrating these theoretical foundations into a path-planning framework for planar manipulators, with a focus on handling complex configurations and constrained environments effectively.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Extras:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide user manual for researchers and engineers.
